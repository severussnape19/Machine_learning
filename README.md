Hey there! This repo is where I’m learning machine learning step by step — from the basics to real-world projects. It’s all hands-on, and I’m sharing my progress as I go.

# What’s Inside?
1-data-preprocessing: Encoding, scaling, splitting — all the prep work.

2-regression: Linear regression, visualizations, and some experiments.

3-classification: Logistic regression and how to measure how well it works.

# Tools
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook, VSCode and google colab

# Goals
Get solid with ML fundamentals

Build and deploy real AI projects
