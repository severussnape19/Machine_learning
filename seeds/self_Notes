1. Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)
What it tells me:
Measures how well my clustering results match the true class labels, while correcting for random chance.

Range:
-1 (worst), 0 (random labeling), 1 (perfect match)
 Above 0.7 = Strong agreement

My Result (0.773):
My clusters closely match the true labels.
So, my clustering approach is meaningful and aligned with actual classes.

 2. Normalized Mutual Information (NMI)
What it tells me:
Checks how much information is shared between predicted clusters and actual class labels.

Range:
0 (no shared info) to 1 (perfect correlation)

My Result (0.728):
A lot of the structure in the true labels is captured by my clusters, even if label numbers differ.
This means the clustering follows similar patterns as the actual labels.

3. Silhouette Score
What it tells me:
Evaluates how well each point fits in its cluster vs. how far it is from other clusters.
In short — measures cluster tightness and separation.

Range:
-1 (bad), 0 (overlapping), 1 (ideal)
 ~0.5 = Good separation,
~0.3–0.4 = Some overlap

My Result (0.401):
My clusters are moderately well-separated, with some overlap.
Still a decent result for biological data like wheat seed varieties.

Summary Table
Score	                    Measures	                          What it Tells Me
ARI	            Match with true labels (adjusted)	      My clusters are aligned with actual classes
NMI            	Shared structure/information	          I captured the underlying label patterns
Silhouette	     Cluster cohesion + separation	          My clusters are compact, but slightly overlapping

I learned how to measure different metrics such as ARI, NMI and Silhouette through this mini project. It was quite a fun project! I learned
alot through this and also identified my mistakes. I have a long road ahead and hoping to get better as i progress!
