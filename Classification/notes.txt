### Self Notes###
Classification: Used to predict categories
-> Contains both linear and non linear models

-> Logistic regression curve is called as the sigmoid curve and it is a linear model.
-> KNN assigns a new point based on how many neighbors of each cateogory it has. The new data point gets assigned to the category which has the most closest points.

We don't fit the X_test with the standard scaler as it causes data leakage.
i.e, if we fit the the Standard scaler with the X_test, the model already knows the values inside the test set. This might make the model have more accuracy but it
will cause the model to not perform the same with new data.
(It's like giving away questions way before an exam)

Used a very simple data set to learn new models.
The graphs are from chatGPT!
