In medical diagnosis, especially for cancer detection, minimizing False Negatives is very important.
A False Negative means, a cancerous case is wrongly predicted as non-cancerous, which means the people who need to be treated assume they're fine.
This can be very dangeorous as the person who really needs the treatment won't be treated and the cancer will progress which threatens their life.

# Naive Bayes and Support vector machine with the RBF kernel gave out the most false negatives.
# 7 and 5 false postives respectively.
# Accuracies are 94.9% and 95.6% respectively.

# Even with pretty good acuracy rates, I would'nt prefer using Naive Bayes as it has the most false poitives. 

# The plots in the notebook show us the amount of false positives and their overall accuracy scores.

# Logistic regression and Decision tree classification both had 95.6% accuracy while having only 3 false positives.
Though I'd prefer higher accuracy and lesser false negatives.
