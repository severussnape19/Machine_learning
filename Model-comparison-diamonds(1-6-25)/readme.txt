Have to be more aware and should practice SVR
# SVR and Random forest seem to be more accurate but their training time seems to be longer.
# Increasing the 'degrees' in polynomial regression seems to also increase the training time as the data set is already big and its creating more features by exponentiating all the columns. Makes sense
